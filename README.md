# AI Security Monitoring System (MVP) 🚀

[Русская версия (Russian Version)](./README_RU.md)

An intelligent video surveillance system powered by **YOLOv8**, designed for automatic person detection, skeletal analysis (pose estimation), and multi-camera monitoring.

---

## Key Features 🛠

- **Skeleton Detection (Pose Estimation)**: Uses `YOLOv8-pose` model to identify 17 body keypoints in real-time.
- **Multi-Camera Mode**: Supports simultaneous display of multiple video streams in a grid (Grid View).
- **Auto-Camera Discovery**: Automatically detects connected USB cameras, prioritizing external devices over built-in ones.
- **Performance Optimization**:
    - Uses lightweight `nano` models for high FPS.
    - Optimized processing resolution (640px).
    - Multi-threaded video processing for a smooth UI.
- **Modern GUI**: Dark theme built with `CustomTkinter`.

## Installation & Setup 🚀

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vash-username/security-intelligence-system.git
cd security-intelligence-system
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Virtual environment is recommended.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare models
On first run, the app will automatically download the necessary `yolov8n-pose.pt` weights to the `models/` folder. You can also download them manually from the [Ultralytics repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

### 4. Run
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## Multi-Camera Configuration 📹

To change the list of cameras, open `app/config.py` and edit the following parameter:
```python
CAMERA_INDICES = [0, 1]  # Your camera indices
```
The system will automatically adjust the grid layout based on the number of cameras.
